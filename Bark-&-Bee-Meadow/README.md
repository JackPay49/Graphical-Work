This directory contains the logo I created for the business Standish Dog Trainer (https://standishdogtrainer.co.uk/) for their new business of "Bark & Bee Meadow". This was a dog waling field. For this I edited their previous logo into a new one and even came up with the name for the field. I finished this small project by hiring a vendor on Etsy to laser etch this logo into a sign.
